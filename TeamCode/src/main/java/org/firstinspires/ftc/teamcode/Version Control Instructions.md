    In this project, we have implemented Version control software, which will keep track of every change that
    we make in the code. This will instruct you on how to use the software.

    1. When finished coding, save your project by pressing "Ctrl+S".
    2. Click on the green checkmark in the "Git" portion of the toolbar.
    3. Type a commit message saying what you did with the code.
    4. Type your name in the "Author" section.
    5. Check the "Sign-off commit" box.
    6. Click the dropdown next to commit.
    7. Click "Commit and Push".
    8. Click "Push".

     Once your tests have been tested and approved by the lead programmer and captain,
     you can merge the branch back into the master code.

    1. Switch to the Master branch, (see "CHANGING BETWEEN BRANCHES").
