    In this project, we have implemented Version control software, which will keep track of every change that we make in the code.
    This will instruct you on how to use the software.

    1. When you are finished coding, either press "ctrl + k", or click on "VCS", then "Commit".
    2. Change the commit message to say what you added, deleted, or changed.
    3. Click the dropdown next to "commit".
    4. Click on "Commit and Push".
    5. Click "Push".

    NOTES:

    ADDING BRANCHES:
    
    1. When adding an experimental part of the code, go to the bottom right corner of the screen, and click on "Git: master".
    2. Click "New Branch".
    3. Add Name and click "Ok".
    4. You will then be working on that branch.

    CHANGING BETWEEN BRANCHES:

    1. To switch which branch you are on, go to the bottom right corner of the screen, and click on "Git: ******".
    2. Click on the branch that you want to switch to.
    3. Click on "Checkout"
    4. Be sure to commit the code BEFORE switching.

    MERGING BRANCHES:

     Once your tests have been tested and approved by the lead programmer and captain,
     you can merge the branch back into the master code.

    1. Switch to the Master branch, (see "CHANGING BETWEEN BRANCHES").
    2. Go to the bottom right corner of the screen and click on "Git: master".
    3. Click on the branch the you want to merge.
    4. Click on "Merge into Current".
    5. If it is the fist merge, Click on "Smart Merge".
